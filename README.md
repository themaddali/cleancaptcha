# cleancaptcha

CleanCaptcha is an open source effort to add meaning to Captcha.
There are several instances when we feel frustrated with the crazy images that come up on websites and blogs to find out if we are human beings. At times these images are in human.

As BOTs it gets more and more smarter, the captcha get more and more tougher.
On the other hand, if we take a step back and re think – “Do you really need such a strong captcha, or are you using it just because it is available”  - The answer to this clear issue is CleanCaptcha.

Now you might wonder, is this 100% safe, I don’t think so. But do we need to be 100% safe for a site with < 1Mil traffic, site with no profiles or confidential information? This will soother your frustration and will solve the only problem it is intended to solve and nothing else.
